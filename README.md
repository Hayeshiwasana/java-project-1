We have planned to designed software solution for wholesale retail shop by using object-oriented modelling techniques.  There is a direct link between customer satisfaction and company profits.so we should have reliant service on customers by having items in stock, otherwise customers will simply go to other shop. Hence, effective stock management is very important to increase company profits. We have developed an object-oriented program to solve stock management problems and customer care services.  Any customer who would like to join as registered member, can sign up for free.  The company owner has super admin account, and he can manage all the users of the system, ask for reports and manages bill using his account.  All the employees who work in the shop has categorized to job roles. Within them stock keeper, shop keeper and system user only have the access to this system. Stock keeper create reports, update and manage stock. System user can create, update and delete accounts of customers and movies. Shop keeper will collect payments and create reports. Company owner can see the generated reports. This course work uses UML and java to design and implement an object oriented system
